Based on the advice of Rebecca and Keith, I kicked off week 2 by having
the students sit on the carpet in front of the board while I demonstrated
[Whack-a-witch](http://codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/codeclub-whackawitch.pdf),
the project theyâ€™d soon be coding.

This is a really good technique. I used this relatively calm moment to ask the
students how they were doing, whether they were enjoying the sunshine, and
who had tried out Scratch at home. Happily, the majority had.

- Spend a decent amount of time helping each student
- The `move (variable) steps` penny-drop
- Printing worksheets
- Have a trick up your sleeve
