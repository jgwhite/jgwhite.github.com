title: 'Code Club: Week 5'

**This post is a work in progress**

[De Beauvoir Primary][dbp] is about 400 metres from [Studio 100][studio100],
where I work. Last week, I decided to capitalise upon this proximity by
running an extra lunchtime session on Wednesday. I honestly think this
is one of the best decisions I’ve made so far running the club. Instead
of the usual twelve students I got four; two of whom are usually a bit
quieter in the after school club.

We used the time to finish of fruit machine, one of the more challenging
projects from Code Club Term One. In spending a little longer working with
each student, it became clear that at least one has developed a true
intuition for the mechanics of programming in Scratch. Working rapidly
through the step-by-step instructions and jumping head first into the
unaided exercises at the end.

I’m not sure how, but we managed to squeeze almost an hour out of the
lunchtime session. I was elated at the progress I’d seen, and enthused
for the next day’s club.

Fish Chomp is one of my favourite of the code club projects. The
gameplay is simple and fun, it encourages students to record their own
sounds, and it leaves plenty of room for adaptation. Added to all that
good stuff, it also incorporates something close to a [Random Walk][random]
algorithm for the runaway lobsters.

From personal experience, learning about algorithms like this is a real
eye-opener. They’re simple, unpredictable, and produce almost life-like
results. Things get even better when you discover algorithms to simulate
2D and then 3D physics.
