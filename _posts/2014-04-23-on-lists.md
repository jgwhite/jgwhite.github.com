title: On Lists
---

Colleague and all-round smart person [Anna Goss][1] recently wrote on
the subject of [List Addiction][2]. She writes frankly about using
lists to cope with the “scale of life”. I think she’s also talking
about the scale of her own ambitions.

I use lists to capture who I want to become. Most of the time, I can’t
divert enough willpower to enact any of this stuff. So instead I
catalogue it, in the hope that one day I won’t be so lazy.

In [Three Things][3], Jeff Atwood suggests a heuristic to replace
to-do lists:

> What three things do you need to do today?

Do away with the lists. Train your brain instead.

It’s a compelling argument. I take the same tack with bookmarks.

Maybe there’s value in storing certains kinds of to-dos
externally. Especially when it comes to ambitions.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, MORE TO COME**
