title: On Lists
---

Colleague and all-round smart person [Anna Goss][1] recently wrote on
the subject of [List Addiction][2]. She writes frankly about using
lists to cope with the “scale of life”. I think she’s talking about
the scale of her own ambition.

I use lists to capture who I want to become. Most of the time, I can’t
divert enough willpower to enact any of it. So instead I catalogue in
the hope that one day I won’t be so lazy. I’m fairly certain I’m not
unique in this regard.

In [Three Things][3], Jeff Atwood suggests a heuristic to replace
to-do lists:

> What three things do you need to do today?

Do away with lists. Train your brain instead. It’s a compelling idea…

What if those things contradict with each other? Or with tomorrow’s
things? I don’t know about you but I’m not so good at
compartmentilising. If something’s on my mind it tends to interefere
with eveything else.

For those of us who keep lists this [cognitive dissonance][4] is a
roadblock.
